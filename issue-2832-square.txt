When stroking paths with a very small stroke width, sometimes the
output will be incorrect. This is because HideStrokePointsCircle
skips too far ahead when it is determining which points should be
hidden. This can be seen by importing issue-2832-square.svg. On
unpatched versions, the top right corner is skewed, and tapers
from left to right to become half the width it should be.

Refer to issue-2832-square-expand-stroke-diagram.svg for a 
diagram of how expand stroke works in this case.

Reducing the skip distance may help (at the cost of increasing
computation time of what is essentially an O(n^2) algorithm)
