Associated with FontForge bug #685:
   https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/685

This file demonstrates the problem with FreeType rasterization on large
fonts.  Apologies for the very large file, but the problem only shows up
with fonts that are at least a significant fraction of this size.  The
problem is that generating a bitmap strike with FreeType produces corrupted
results - but only when using FreeType (not FontForge's own rasterization
code), and only when operating on thousands of glyphs at once.  Use the
FontForge native code (possible at one time in the GUI, but that may have
been disabled, and not possible in a script if FreeType has been linked) or
do it a thousand glyphs at a time instead of all at once, and the problem
disappears.  Font is covered by GNU GPL 3 with added font-embedding
permission.
