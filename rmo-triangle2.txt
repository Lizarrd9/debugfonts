Associated with FontForge bug #402:
 https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/402

Remove overlaps on the single glyph in this font cuts off corners, creating
large black areas.  Note that #402 was partially fixed - this file
demonstrates what seems to be the same problem, still unfixed.  Font is
small enough that we can call it public domain.
