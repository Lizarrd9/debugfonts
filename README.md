==========

FontForge bug reports often involve sample fonts demonstrating the issues,
which cannot be conveniently included as text in Github tickets.  This
repository provides a convenient way of posting them.

If you have a font you'd like to share as part of a bug report, please
include it in a pull request against this repository.  Please also include a
.txt file alongside the .sfd or other font file, containing a description of
where the font file comes from and what it demonstrates.
