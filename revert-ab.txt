Associated with FontForge bug #486:
 https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/486

Two font files (revert-a.pfb and revert-b.pfb) demonstrating the
longstanding "revert to more glyphs" problem: if a glyph is added to a file
outside FontForge, doing "revert" to load the new file in the GUI causes a
segfault.  Fonts are GPL3 with embedding permission.
